# Clarinet-Piece

This is just a collection of scripts I am using for an electroacoustic piece of music I'm working on. They are used in a Max for Live patch, since it's nice to handle the "administrative" stuff in JavaScript and the signal processing with the regular Max objects. This repository in itself isn't very helpful for anything.
